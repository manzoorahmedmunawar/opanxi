# opanxi 

### opanxi theme is a flat green gtk & gnome shell theme it gives you flat and manjaro style gtk looks on any linux distribution.

I created this theme because I was unable to find a good match for my taste on www.gnome-look.org  . I am sharing this with you to try, test & report bugs and this theme is in my personal use and it is fun to play with gtk and gnome-shell I will try to donate as much of my free time as I can to make this project perfect.
